Been a year since I’ve
Left it all behind
Taking count of nights
Just three hundred sixty five

Sixty seconds left
Now I count to five
Count on me instead
Now my minute equals life

To me it’s beautiful
When there’s no time at all
No rushing but
Follow, you’re going in circles now

It hides in your heart,
You don't hurry me up,
My time is now,
Follow, but you haven't made anything .

I'm the only one,
Gravity I found,
Would you stand by me
Watching arrows going round?

Time is to begin
When it comes to end,
Thought I'd have it all,
Now it's slipping through my hands.

To me it's beautiful
When there's no time at all,
No rushing but
Follow, you're going in circles now.

It hides in your heart,
You don't hurry me up,
My time is now,
Follow, but you haven't made anything .

What I'm reaching for
Neither death nor life,
I'm in time no more
These three hundred sixty five...

Now with you I share,
Start your fair game,
Sorry, out of air:
Saving empty space for pain.

To me it's beautiful
When there's no time at all,
No rushing but
Follow, you're going in circles now.

It hides in your heart,
You don't hurry me up,
My time is now,
Follow, but you haven't made anything
